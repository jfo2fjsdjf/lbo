An architectural design studio in Yongjia Road, Shanghai, China, designed to superimpose a new, flexible spatial system on top of an existing building.It transforms a 30-square-meter urban space (a former takeaway workstation and dormitory) into a communal activity and accommodation space shared by young people.Through the alleyway outside the site, the public space of the city is further introduced into the building.

The laundry poles divide the sky into large and small squares, storm and gas pipes surround walls and air, plants climb on all surfaces, these are the stages of mutual invasion between public space and private space. As for the tunnel with too many elements to have too many features, the architects chose a "semi-open" architecture that blends public and private spaces at the end of the lane-way. On the one hand, from the main entrance, people in the outdoor space can see the canvas canopy covering the front area of the main entrance and the terrace above, forming a soft and complete interface as the opposite view of the roadway space. On the other hand, the grey space formed by the canvas canopy provides a spatial and visual buffer for the entrance at the end of the laneway, which reduces the pressure of the external public space invading the private space.

The designer therefore creates an opportunity for the two sides to communicate at the boundary between the bedroom area and the reception area. Also the opening of doors and windows becomes the carrier of multiple space overlap through the change of the depth relationship.

Besides, each bedroom has a window to the reception area, a window to the outdoor space and a door opening for access, allowing the user to decide which part of the external space to contact. The bedroom size can be very small. The designer arranged three groups of bedrooms with different elevations in the height of about 12㎡, and connected by a staircase. Different from the technique of material and image collage in the reception area, the designer used wood veneer to cover the bedroom area, in order to minimize the interference of materials on the space experience, and focus on the relationship between multiple Spaces.
