During this tutorial, I deleted the ordinary staircase which took up more space last time, and changed it to spiral staircase, which saved more space.And appropriate adjustment of the bedroom, living room space. It also borrows from Japan's KOWA public housing complex Studio Velocity. A suitable space can be created for the outdoor garden to stop and appreciate, and there is a large area of light on the second floor. The model below shows the direction of light.
