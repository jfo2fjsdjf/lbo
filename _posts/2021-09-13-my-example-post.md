# Definition of home
Home is not an exact place or space. It is a collection of feelings stories and memories. In my opinion, the place where people are is the place where home is located. The ties between relatives, neighbors and neighbors build the ties of home. And relatives of different ages need different space to live together, to adapt to the living habits of different ages. And the relationship between neighbors is also an important meaning of the word family. There is an ancient Chinese proverb that distant relatives are not as good as close neighbors. A good neighborhood relationship can create a better family relationship.
