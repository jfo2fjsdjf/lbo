An architectural design studio in Yongjia Road, Shanghai, China, designed to superimpose a new, flexible spatial system on top of an existing building.It transforms a 30-square-meter urban space (a former takeaway workstation and dormitory) into a communal activity and accommodation space shared by young people.Through the alleyway outside the site, the public space of the city is further introduced into the building.
